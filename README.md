# Winclipper

Winclipper is a lightweight Win32 application that saves everything that you copy so that you can paste it later when you really need it. It's designed with Unicode in mind so that you can copy any character from any language or a string of emojis and know that it will paste correctly.

A built in preview ensures that you know exactly what you are pasting when a single-line preview isn't enough. Other clipboard applications have been useful to me for software development, but in my day-to-day work I regularly have to copy multiple lines of code that all look similar from the first line (lots of xml); that is the problem that Winclipper is built to solve.

The menu is simple and can be summoned with a hotkey of your choice (default: Ctrl + Shift + V), or accessed through its taskbar tray icon. It can be configured to show as much or as little information as you like.

## Building Winclipper

You will need Visual Studio 2017 to build Winclipper. The solution file should contain everything that you need to build. If you want to build the setup projects, then you will need to install [WiX](http://wixtoolset.org).

## Updates

Still looking for a good update system, but once I do, current users will need to reinstall, so just be prepared for that.
